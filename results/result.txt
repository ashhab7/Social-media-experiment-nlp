Ans: If the sentence ```You are so dead``` is posted in any social media, it violates rule 4 of the Community Guidelines.
Rule 4 of the Community Guidelines states that ``Posts that are deemed as offensive, threatening, or harmful to other members of the community are prohibited.``
The sentence ```You are so dead``` is offensive and threatening in nature, as it implies that the person who receives the message will die or be harmed in some way. This type of language is not acceptable on social media and violates the Community Guidelines.
In addition to violating the Community Guidelines, posting a sentence like ```You are so dead``` can also lead to legal consequences.
